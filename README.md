# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Project Description and objectives 
Brianna and I worked on the code on the finch to allow it to dance and make some music. We based it on a dance that is commonly used as parties like Hoco & Prom 
## Descrition of design choices
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Our robot is doing that dance that goes Back forward left right for 4 cycles then it will play its song. The code used loops to control how many times it turns and does its moves


##  Challenges faced and solutions
- Our biggest challenge was getting the computers to work using git and other things we had to download.
- Then understanding how the ficnh code work while using Git to move the finch
- we had to look through the finch code to understand how to tell it preprogrammed methods
-we used comments and java docs
- We believe that our robot met most if not all the requirements 
## Future   
- If we had more time with less hicups throught the coding project we would have made the robot do more moves.
### Video or images of our Finch in action
- Choose your challenge: dance, with a song
- Explore the Finch API documentation
- Review sample programs from BirdBrain Technologies
- Create a project plan with pseudocode/flow charts/
- Clone and set up GitHub repository for your project

- Method overloading or overriding
- Loops (for, while, etc.)
- Conditional statements
- File I/O for configuration or logging
- Constants and static methods


### Documentation Requirements
- Well-commented code with appropriate Javadoc
- GitHub repository with organized file structure
- README.md file including:
  * Project description and objectives
  * Description of design choices
  * Challenges faced and solutions
  * Future enhancements
  * Video or images of your robot in action (embedded or linked)

## Challenge-Specific Guidelines

### Dance Challenge
Create a choreographed dance routine for your Finch that synchronizes:
- Movement patterns (forward/backward, turns)
- LED light displays (beak and tail)
- Sound patterns using the buzzer
- Consider using arrays to store sequences of movements/lights/sounds

### Drawing Challenge
Program your Finch to create an artistic drawing:
- Design an algorithm to create a recognizable pattern or image
- Use precise motor control for clean lines
- Consider incorporating sensor data to affect the drawing
- Create a system to track position on the drawing surface

### Maze Navigation Challenge
Program your Finch to navigate through a maze:
- Use distance sensors to detect walls
- Implement an algorithm for maze solving (wall following, etc.)
- Consider storing and analyzing the path taken
- Add visual/audio feedback during navigation
- Optional: Allow for maze "learning" and optimization on repeated runs

## Resources
- Finch API Documentation (provided in class)
- [BirdBrain Technologies Learning Resources](https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/java/program/)
- [Java API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)

## Extension Opportunities
If you complete your chosen challenge early, consider:
- Adding sensor-responsive behaviors to your program
- Creating a user interface to control robot parameters (JFrame, Swing, JavaFX)
- Implementing multiple modes of operation
- Adding an obstacle detection and avoidance system
